This project is designed to predict the number of calories burnt by a person using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes key physiological and activity-related features—such as age, gender, height, weight, heart rate, and exercise duration—to estimate calorie expenditure accurately.

Using a dataset of real activity measurements, the notebook includes:
Data preprocessing & cleaning
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Feature selection and scaling
Model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or other algorithms)
Model evaluation using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R²
Prediction of calories burnt for new input values
This project can help in fitness tracking, exercise planning, and developing personalized health applications.
